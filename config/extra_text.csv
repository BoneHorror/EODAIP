1000510name;Fate of France;;;;;;;;;;X;
1000510desc;"The Fall of France shocked the world, as France was believed to have the strongest land army in existence when war broke out yet again in 1939. The subsequent Armistice at Compiegne was only expected to be a short term ordeal, and a proper peace treaty would be negotiated once the United Kingdom had come to terms with the Third Reich. However, instead of what many believed would only be a weeks, or at most months long affair, much of France remained under German occupation for years as the Second World War raged on. With the war in the Europe finally coming to an end, it is time to formally prepare a peace treaty with France and create the New Order in Europe.\n \nHitler had widely varying opinions of France and the French people. He viewed many of them as ""Germanics in denial"" and treated them with the same general respect of other western Europeans, which was highly in contrast to his views of the Slavic peoples of Russia. He intended to make France forever dependent on Germany to eliminate the threat of another war breaking out within Europe ever again. One of the more consistent themes in his writing was the fact that France would always oppose Germany regardless of any other geopolitical circumstances.\n \nWe can now begin the process of determining the future of France and its role in the New Order. We may choose to examine each area and tailor the peace treaty specifically to our interests, or choose to enforce general terms right away.";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000511name;Fate of Benelux;;;;;;;;;;X;
1000511desc;The invasion of the Low Countries during the invasion of France would result in the creation of two political entities with distinctive characteristics of the National Socialist movement, each with long-term goals for incorporation into the Reich itself.\n \nReichskommissariat Niederlande was a civilian occupation regime set up in the occupied Netherlands after it fell to the German invasion in 1940. Hitler envisioned the direct assimilation of the Dutch people into the Reich itself at a later date, seeing them as part of the Aryan herrenvolk and therefore belonging to the Germanic realm.\n \nThe Reichskommissariat set up in Belgium was not created until 1944, and was administered by a military government before this time. Including all of Belgium proper (aside from Eupen, which had been annexed into Germany) and also an area of iron-rich territory in northern France, this regime was also intended for future assimilation into the Reich. Figures such as Himmler and Goebbels viewed both the Flemish and Walloon nations as Germanic in racial quality, and therefore worthy of being part of the Greater Germanic Reich. We may also choose to restore the sovereign governments of these states, though we would not be able to integrate them at a later time.;;;;;;;;;;X;

1000512name;The Breton Question;;;;;;;;;;X;
1000512desc;The Second World War saw the uprising of many nationalist groups, the most well known example of which would be the Germans themselves. Many of these movements have passed into history as historical curiosities. The Breton Nationalist movement is another little-known idea that was emboldened by the conflict, most notably by the German occupation of northern France and the region of Britanny itself.\n \nBritanny formally become part of France in 1547 and is generally seen as an integral part of the state. During the war, the Breton National Party dominated local activist groups and were a considerable force. Germany was interested in fostering separatist movements in France in an attempt to weaken their foe, particularly strong sentiments in the region of Flanders and Britanny. Breaking French national unity would only help the Germans in accomplishing their goals, and the Abwehr (German military intelligence) worked with these parties in the interest of this goal.\n \nAn unprecedented opportunity has presented itself for the Breton nation. The leaders of the Breton Nationalist Party, Francois Debeauvais and Olier Mordrel, have petitioned us to create a new Breton state under our guidance. They clearly understand that they will be subordinate to the Reich, and this regime could serve as a very useful outpost to ensure our interests in western France and the Atlantic remain secure.;;;;;;;;;;X;

1000512b;An independent Britanny is not in our interests.;;;;;;;;;;X;
1000513name;Creation of SS-Ordensstaat Burgund;;;;;;;;;;X;
1000513desc;"The SS-Ordensstaat Burgund (SS Order State of Burgundy) was a proposed state that would roughly encompass the medieval borders of the Kingdom of Burgundy. Initially proposed by Heinrich Himmler, he envisioned the transformation of this territory that was once part of the Holy Roman Empire into a model state that would foster a renaissance of European culture under the guidance of the SS. Even the name ""Ordersstaat"" was a historical reference to the medieval state of the Teutonic Order, revered in certain circles as the progenitor of modern Germany. The state's language would initially be French, but through generations of state education would eventually become German.\n \nAlthough Hitler intended to restore the late medieval borders of the Holy Roman Empire by annexing a considerable part of eastern France, Himmler's plans for the SS state also includes Mediterranean access through Provence and large swathes of the French heartland that was once Burgundian territory. Hitler stated that the former area of Burgundy would need to be annexed at some point, which France ""had taken from Germany in her weakest moment"". This grand vision also conflicts with Italy's gains in Chambery and Nice which Himmler is also claiming, and we should make our choice carefully. We may never again have such an opportunity to so greatly weaken France and truly restore the Reich's greatest extent!";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000514name;The French State;;;;;;;;;;X;
1000514desc;"The French State, or more commonly known as Vichy France, was the collaborationist regime set up under Philippe Petain after negotiating with Adolf Hitler on the future of France. Still a controversial figure to this day, Petain believed that he was acting in the best interests of the French by choosing to work with Germany. He held sympathy to the idea that Europe would soon be united under German dominance, that the destiny of Europa lies in ""Une Europe sous l'Allemagne"" - and that the French would be a valuable ally in this Europe united under Germany. With the war concluded, the French government has moved back to Paris and sent a delegation to Versailles at our behest.\n \nHitler has chosen the location of the peace negotiations at this very significant location - the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles. Knowing that the French are in no position to negotiate against the Reich that has cast aside all enemies that have stood before it, Petain and his entourage agree to the terms presented - the Third Treaty of Versailles has been signed.\n \nIn 1871, the German Empire was proclaimed in this beautiful hallmark of European culture, and in 1919 the despised treaty made possible by the November Criminals was put to pen here as well. Now, on this historic day, the war in the Europe comes to an end and the New Order dawns. We have achieved what no other German statesman has ever accomplished before, and France will never be a threat to us ever again!";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000600name;The Treaty of Moscow;;;;;;;;;;X;
1000600desc;"The war in the east has come to an end. Through brilliant command and the superiority of the Wehrmacht, the cities of Moscow, Leningrad and Stalingrad all fell before our furious blitzkrieg. Leadership within the Soviet Union knew that the complete collapse of their degenerate state was inevitable, forcing them to submit to our demands or face utter annihilation. A final peace treaty has been signed in Moscow between representatives of the remaining Soviet leadership and the German delegation led by Joachim von Ribbentrop. The utter humiliation of the Soviet delegation was palpable as they were forced to submit to our demands in the Kremlin. During the delegations, Wehrmacht soldiers march triumphantly in the Red Square as the Reichskriegsflagge is raised above St. Basil's Cathedral. Where Napoleon had failed, the Reich has triumphed.\n \nOur demands were clear - all territory west of the Volga river would be ceded to the Reich in perpetuity. This would also include the area of Astrakhan and all territory west of the Sukhana and Dvina rivers, including the city of Arkhangelsk. All territory between the Gulf of Finland and the Barents Sea would be ceded to Finland or placed under German administration as we saw fit. The area of Bessarabia would be returned to Romania, and the territory of Odessa up to the Dnister river would be ceded to Romania as well.\n \nThe war in the east, or as Hitler would later call it ""The War of Germanic Awakening"" has come to an end.

1000601name;Victory parade in Berlin;;;;;;;;;;;
1000601desc;With the conclusion of the war in the east, a grand parade has been staged in Berlin. Since the signing of the peace treaty with the Soviets, Goebbels and his staff have been hastily preparing the most prestigious celebrations ever seen in Germany. The Führer himself rides with the procession, much to the adoration of the cheering crowds. Any rumours of his failing health have been cast into serious doubt as he appears more vital that ever, invigorated by the victory over the Soviet Union. Many of our men from the eastern front were given temporary leave of absence to attend the momentous event, much to the joy of their families and young German women who have been eagerly awaiting their return. They come home not only as soldiers, but as heroes that have destroyed the greatest threat ever known to European civilization - Bolshevism. The Luftwaffe takes to the skies in the largest air show ever seen as the Wehrmacht steps in perfect unison in the streets below.\n \nThe event, while a genuine display of relief at the victorious result of the titanic struggle against the Soviets, was designed primarily as a propaganda show to soothe the German public in anticipation of our struggles yet to come. The remaining Allied nations still need to be convinced to cease their senseless struggle against the Reich, and Hitler's vision of Europe ending at the Urals is yet to be fulfilled. Not only that, our greatest logistical challenge is yet to come - the incorporation of our eastern conquests into the Reich. A special program has been created for just that purpose: Generalplan Ost.;;;;;;;;;;X;
1000601a;There is much work to be done. For now, our heroes celebrate.;;;;;;;;;;X;
1000602name;Generalplan Ost - First Phase;;;;;;;;;;;
1000602desc;Generalplan Ost refers to the organized plan of German colonization that would be needed to effectively integrate the conquered territories of the Soviet Union both during and after the war on the eastern front. There were a variety of propositions for this idea, most notably by the RKF (Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood), an office held by ReichsFührer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Through a planned program of settling German populations in the lands annexed from the Soviet Union, it was expected that the realization of this vision could be accomplished in approximately 20 to 25 years with the migration of 8 to 10 million settlers. After the German defeat at Stalingrad in 1943, these concepts were largely abandoned due to the turning tide of the war.\n \nNow that the war with the Soviet Union has been won, these plans can be put into motion. This will require an enormous investment of industrial capacity, supplies transportation, manpower, raw resources, money, and a large police force to keep control in the conquered territory. The final version of Generalplan Ost has been prepared by the RKF, and only awaits your approval. Once the quoted expenses are approved, the Ostministerium will immediately begin allocating resources towards developing the east. Be sure that the Reich is prepared before you take on this monumental project.;;;;;;;;;;X;
1000602a;These lands will be German in both blood and soil.;;;;;;;;;;X;
1000602b;Do not speak of this idea ever again.;;;;;;;;;;X;
1000603name;Generalplan Ost - Pacification of the East;;;;;;;;;;;
1000603desc;Upon the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, many local residents initially saw the Germans as potential liberators of the repressive Soviet regime. However, the occupation policies pursued by their would-be saviors against communism made it abundantly clear that Hitler's foreign policy did not have collaboration in mind. Disappointed and disenfrachised, many of these groups took up arms against the occupying Germans in the territories of the Baltic States, Ukraine, Belarus and Poland. One of the primary effects of these resistance movements was disruption of already overextended German supply lines, causing chaos and supply shortages on the front lines. Later in the war, the Red Army would coordinate assaults with partisan cells, making them a vital component in their war against the Reich.\n \nEliminating the resistance of these partisan groups is the initial objective of Generalplan Ost. The safety of German settlers and their families must be assured, and the land must be made available for their homesteads. Our forces are now in position to begin pacifying the local populations of our conquered territory. Once this phase of Generalplan Ost is completed, we may begin aggressively colonizing and developing infrastructure.\n \nThis action will be sure to provoke heavy resistance against us. We are already receiving reports of underground partisan movements collaborating for a large-scale uprising in response to our sanitization forces being put into place. Be sure to police the eastern territories well, or these rebellions may get out of control! We will be unable to progress with our plans if any of our territory is under the control of partisans.;;;;;;;;;;X;

1000605name;Uprising in the East;;;;;;;;;;;
1000605desc;After the surrender of the Soviet Union, residents of the conquered areas were uncertain what their fate as part of the Reich would be. A few months after the conclusion of the war, it quickly became apparent that they had fallen under the rule of an even more brutal regime than what they had experienced under Stalin. What began as localized incidents has erupted into an enormous partisan uprising encompassing all of the conquered Soviet territories.\n \nFrom the Baltic to the Caucasus, local populations have risen up in a final attempt to liberate themselves. People of all nationalities and ideologies now realize that they are engaged in a definitive Kulturkampf against us, and they have set aside their differences to unite against our will. We must crush this rebellion before our plans can move forward! ;;;;;;;;;;X;

1000606desc;What wasn't already destroyed by the German blitzkrieg in the former territories of the Soviet Union now lies in shambles. The mass uprising that erupted in response to our initial stages of Generalplan Ost has been crushed, and along with it, much of the infrastructure and industry that was left intact after the war. From deliberate sabotage to collateral damage, the East lies in ruins - a graveyard of bodies, rubble and machinery. Plumes of smoke rise above the landscape as our forces patrol the countryside for any remaining pockets of resistance.\n \nAlthough we have lost a great deal of heavy industry and useful infrastructure, the pacification of the east has been conveniently accelerated by this conflict. Cleanup crews are already at work clearing the land for future development. The majority of the factories and infrastructure that was damaged in the chaos will take some time to rebuild and staff with laborers. While it will still take many years before the final pockets of resistance have been eliminated, we can now begin the next phases of Generalplan Ost.;;;;;;;;;;X;

1000612name;Generalplan Ost - Eastern Colonization;;;;;;;;;;;
1000612desc;Now that the most chaotic elements of our eastern conquests have been quelled, the next phase of Generalplan Ost may begin.\n \nFour zones in particular are critical to the future of the German nation. First is the area of Gotengau, encompassing the Crimean peninsula and the fertile plains of Zhitomir along the Dnieper River. Second is the area of Memel-Narew which spans from Bialystok up to Riga, including all of Lithuania. Third is the area of Ingermannland, stretching from Leningrad along the borders of the Baltic states to the end of the Wolchow River and along the Volga to the east. Finally, the Baku province in the southern Caucasus with its rich oil reserves must be incorporated into the Reich to ensure that the lifeblood of our industries will never be dependent on foreign trade ever again.\n \nWith the exception of Baku, we expect it will take about 20 years and 8 to 10 million settlers in total to fully Germanize these territories, but we will be able to integrate them in far less time. Finalized plans for the incorporation of these vital areas have been prepared by the RKF, and only await your approval.;;;;;;;;;;X;

1000613desc;"The Crimean peninsula, rechristened ""Gotengau"" by Himmler, along with the rich northern farmland along the the Dnieper River must become an integral part of the Reich and the principal focus in developing our Lebensraum. The fertile fields that stretch from the Sea of Azov all the way up to central Ukraine must become the breadbasket of Europe.\n \nCrimea is the ancient homeland of the Goths, an Eastern Germanic tribe that once lived all the way from here to coast of the Baltic Sea. SS archaeologists are already hard at work uncovering long-forgotten artifacts of our Aryan ancestors. Simferopol has been rechristed ""Gotenburg"" and Sevastopol to ""Theodorichshafen"" in honor of the ancient Gothic king. Plans have been drafted to foster a Germanic society of ""Wehrbauren"", soldier-peasants of the SS who will develop these lands along with their wives and children. 300 acres of land will be granted to each family, with a distribution and labor plan resembling medieval feudalism. To make this land seem more like home, thousands of great oak trees will be planted. With time, the landscape will resemble the idyllic countryside of Schleswig-Holstein.\n \nDisplaced Germans from Sudtirol will be brought in immediately to begin the colonization under Himmler's watchful eye. We are ready to begin this transformative event, and only await your approval.";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000614name;Generalplan Ost - Memel-Narew;;;;;;;;;;;
1000614desc;The settlement zone of Memel-Narew spans from the administrative district of Bialystok up to and including the city of Riga, with its east-west border encompassing all of Lithuania. The territory's direct border with eastern Prussia makes it an ideal location for German settlement, both geographically and logistically. Expansion of the Reich on its eastern frontier has been the goal of many German statesmen throughout the centuries, and we have finally achieved our drive towards the east.\n \nDuring the 14th century this area was under the control of the Teutonic Knights, our ancestors who embodied the ideal of the Germanic spirit and provided the foundation for modern day Prussia. When Lithuania was overrun and lost to savages hundreds of years ago, the soil has cried out for capable hands to cultivate and flourish upon it yet again. We have finally answered that call.\n \nThe first stage of this colonization project will be the formal annexation of Bezirk Bialystok now that its strategic importance is no longer significant after our victory over the USSR. Germanization of this province will be greatly accelerated by Dutch settlers brought in from the Nederlandsche Oost-Campagnie. We are ready to begin the process of finally integrating these lands which should have been German centuries ago.;;;;;;;;;;X;

1000615desc;"The area dubbed ""Ingermannland"" by the Swedish roughly encompasses northern and eastern Ingria, with its western border along the Baltic states and spreading southwards to envelop much of the heavily forested land in western Russia. Centuries ago, much of this land was under the control of the Swedish Empire.\n \nSince the reign of Peter the Great, the territory has been tragically Russified and almost all of the ancient Germanic elements have long been diluted out of existence. However, deep in the old forests and marshes there are still Germanic descendants who may be of value to our colonization efforts. Settlement of these lands is critical to establishing the farthest reaches of our frontier.\n \nThe Ostministerium has taken into account the particular challenges that will be faced by settlers within this area, and know that only the most vigilant of the Wehrbauer will be appropriate for Germanizing these territories.

1000616name;Generalplan Ost - Baku;;;;;;;;;;;
1000616desc;During the Second World War, the oil fields of Baku were some of the richest and largest in the world. Soviet control of the Azerbaijani capital region produced 80 percent of the Soviet Union's oil with an impressive total product of 24 million tons in 1942 alone. Case Blue, the Wehrmacht's summer offensive of 1942, had the capture of these oil fields as their primary objective. Historically, the defeat at Stalingrad in 1943 made realization of this goal impossible. Hitler's desire for this territory was so powerful that his generals presented him with a cake of Baku and the Caspian Sea in celebration of their expected seizure of the area in the 1942 summer offensive. Of course, Hitler sliced out Baku for himself.\n \nThe acquisition of these oil fields may be the most vital strategic and economic asset gained from the success of Operation Barbarossa. Though the pumping machinery was heavily damaged in the invasion and by deliberate sabotage of the retreating Soviets, the fact that there is an ocean of oil underneath this land makes it the single most important geographical region that we must consolidate our control over.\n \nHitler has made it abundantly clear that this territory is to become an integral part of the Reich and any investment that can be made into the development, integration, and defense of this area must be pursued as a top priority. Plans for an extensive railway network connecting Baku across the vast distance to the heartland of Germany have already been drafted.;;;;;;;;;;X;

1000626desc;The area contained within the German administrative division of Bialystok compromised a large portion of the former state of Poland, with the city of Bialystok as its center of governance. Unlike other Polish territories that were either annexed into the Reich or brought under the administration of the Generalgouvernement to the south, Bialystok was placed under civil administration and was not incorporated directly into the German state. The district had significant strategic value as a bridgehead on the far bank of the Memel river, which played a major role in the logistics of the invasion of the Soviet Union.\n \nNow that the war on the eastern front is over, Bialystok and its surrounding territory has been incorporated into the Reich. The Third Partition of Poland in 1795 included this as a concession to Prussia, giving us legitimacy in our claims. Its direct border with the eastern frontier made it a natural choice for expansion in the 18th century, and that is still the case today. With the help of Dutch settlers and resettled Germans from other areas, this land is now fully under our control and well underway to complete Germanization.;;;;;;;;;;X;

In 1915, the German aristocrat Silvio von Broed-rich-Kurmalen published a book titled ""Das Neue Ostland"" in which he argued for the annexation of the Baltic territories and the settlement of native Germans in the area. After the surrender of Soviet Russia in 1917 during the First World War, there were discussions of forming a dynastic union between the German Empire and the Duchy of Lithuania. With our victory in the war on the eastern front, the realization of these ideas can be put into motion.\n \nMuch like our settlement of Bialystok, the direct border of Lithuania with eastern Prussia has made the colonization of this area proceed more smoothly than in our other interests. Administration of Lithuania is now composed entirely of Germans, and governance of Lithuania, now known as Memelland, is completely subordinate to us.";;;;;;;;;;X;

This line of demarcation, loosely established by the maximum extent of the conquests of the Teutonic Knights, is now firmly under our control. Resentment from the native population was particularly pronounced in these areas as local governors were sacked from their positions and replaced with German officials. Germanization of western Belarus will take quite some time, as this land has little native Germanic elements that we can utilize to assist us in the process.\n \nWith our establishment of settlements along this eastern frontier, the organic borders of the Reich have reached their greatest extent eastward.

With the shores of Lake Peipus to the west and the stronghold of Holmgard to the east, we have completed the first steps in settling this distant territory of the Reich.\n \nThe city of Novgorod, now rechristened ""Holmgard"", was the easternmost trading post of the Hanseatic League that was once economically dominant over trade in the Baltic Sea. Our renaming of this key city is also in honor of the mythical Norse sagas that told stories of this land in ancient times.\n \nOur settlers have established homesteads and farms in the area, and German administrators control all of the day to day operations in Holmgard.

The old ruins of Leningrad have been completely swept away, its degenerate influence having been cleansed by the purifying fires of the Reich.\n \nIn its place, small German hamlets are beginning to dot the landscape as our consolidation of the east continues. Adolfsburg will be the new gateway to the east once this area has been completely Germanized, and progress on the new city is now far enough along that it can begin serving as a hub for supplies and transportation for our brave pilgrims.\n \nEnough time has passed that we are now seeing our settlers establish trade routes from Holmgard to the Baltic Sea, and reports of harassment by the native population have now all but disappeared.

We have instilled in them a sense of reclamation of the land that rightfully belonged to the domain of the old Swedish Empire. Similar to the Homestead Act that was used by the United States to encourage settlement into their frontier territories, we have granted free parcels of land to those whom are bold enough to stake a new life for themselves in this wilderness. We owe much of our success to to Goebbels and his brilliant propaganda campaigns.\n \nNow that the cities of Holmgard and Adolfsburg have firmly consolidated control in their respective zones of administration, our final push into Ingermannland has began.

One matter in particular requires your direct involvement, a lingering topic that calls out for a resolution and a definitive answer - the Polish Question.\n \nThe final result of the First World War would be the first time in over 100 years that the Polish state would exist as an independent political entity. The blitzkrieg in 1939 smashed the very existence of this state, and territory that is rightfully German such as Danzig, the so-called Polish corridor, Posen, Wartheland, and Bialystok will remain in our hands regardless of what we ultimately choose to do.\n \nA decision must be made. We can choose to begin a program of Germanization under the administration of the Generalgouvernement, maintain the status quo and allow our occupation regime to continue existing, or immediately dissolve the Generalgouvernement and occupy Poland directly. Note that if we choose the final option, we will be unable to sufficiently Germanize the territory and we will not gain national provinces. If we choose to Germanize the Polish state, it will take several years before it will be ready for incorporation into the Reich. The fate of Poland lies in your hands.;;;;;;;;;;X;

Leveraging existing German populations in districts Krakau and Lublin, we have elevated these natives to positions of power within their local governments, allowing them to grant special concessions and favor to Germanic settlers we have brought in from all over Europe. The marginalization of the existing Polish population will ensure that in 15 to 20 years, all of Poland will be on an irrevocable demographic shift.\n \nWe expect to be able to dismiss the Generalgouvernement well before this amount of time is needed, but for now it will facilitate establishing German families within Poland. Now that the districts of Warschau, Radom and Galizien have been separated from each other by these efforts, collaboration among the native Poles will be much more difficult.

In the former Polish capital, all existing signs and street names have been completely replaced by German equivalents. The Polish language has been greatly diminished in daily usage, and anyone that dares to breach this understanding is dealt with appropriately.

Official administration of the region has passed from the Reichskommissariat to our control. The process of Germanization will still take many more generations, but the foundations have been laid.\n \nTo celebrate the realization of his vision, the Führer and Heirich Himmler have taken a public tour across the ancient Gothic homeland of Crimea and communal farms in Ukraine. German farmers look on as the procession drives by toward their final destination in Theodorichshafen. The Wehrbauer of this region are presented with the highest decorations of German society, celebrated as heroes for their contributions to the future of European civilization.

It seemed like a lifetime ago that his vision of the Reich's ambitions seemed so distant, but now they are becoming a reality. Projected estimates for full Germanization are still decades away, but our investments have shown their results since the decision was made to undertake the project.

The Führer's inspection of his far eastern conquests went as smoothly as expected, and this land that once belonged to the Swedish Empire is now an integral part of the Greater Germanic Reich. Though it will still take decades of settlement before this land can truly be called German, we are well on our way to accomplishing this transformative endeavor.

Administration of the zone has become Germanized to the degree that control has passed from our Reichskommissariat directly to us.\n \nAs the Führer's personal plane lands in the city of Baku, local German and Azeri families gather around to celebrate his arrival. He has made a special trip to tour the facilities of his most prized conquest.

In 1762, she declared an invitation for Europeans to settle in Russia and cultivate farmland. These Europeans, mostly Germans from the Rhineland and Bavaria, were allowed to retain their language and customs. Many of these Germans would settle along the Volga River, forming distinct communities.\n \nThis community of Germans was so substantial that in 1924, the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created with a population of about 380,000 native Germans, composing two-thirds of the total population within its jurisdiction. Following the invasion of the Soviet Union, Stalin issued a formal Decree of Banishment which abolished the ASSR and began an intensive program of deportation of the native Germans in the area, fearing they would act as collaborators or spies. Almost all of these Volga Germans were deported to labor camps in central Asia and Siberia, many of whom would perish during and after the war on the eastern front.\n \nWith the defeat of the USSR following Operation Barbarossa, the communist regime has fallen into chaos. Many Germans that survived their forced expulsions have been able to find their way back to their old homes, inspired by the Reich's triumph.

Many of these soldiers would form the backbone of organizations such as the Waffen-SS, making them a vital contribution to the war effort.\n \nUpon Hitler's declaration of war in 1941, the conflict against the Soviet Union took on a uniquely ideological tone that had not been present in the wars before the 20th century. Whereas war in the past had often been based on religious, economic, and dynastic contexts, the eruption between National Socialist Germany and Soviet Russia was based upon both Hitler's desire for Lebensraum in the east and his ideological conviction that Bolshevism was the greatest threat to European civilization and would eventually seek to dominate the entire planet.\n \nThis modern crusade has been successful, and we have ensured the freedom of Europe from those that would seek to enslave her and her descendants.

1000663name;Destruction of Kiev;;;;;;;;;;;
1000663desc;"One of Adolf Hitler's goals in the war against the Soviet Union was the complete annihilation of historic Russian cities such as Kiev, Moscow, Stalingrad (Volgagrad) and Leningrad (St. Petersburg). The purpose of this destruction was both ideologically and racially motivated, as he believed that the razing of these historical cities would be a demonstration of his conviction to annihilate both Bolshevist ideology and major Russian population centers. This would serve as show of force against local partisan groups and remove major resistance cells, along with effectively erasing the existence of the native people from these regions to pave the way for his vision of the Reich's future civilization.\n \nNow that the war with the Soviet Union is over and our forces have began pacifying the eastern conquests, these demolition projects may begin. Kiev is the first location slated to be removed from the map. This idea has met some resistance in the party, particularly from Himmler who refers to Kiev as ""Kiroffo"", believing that it may be the grounds of an ancient Germanic city.

1000665desc;The capture of Leningrad, along with Moscow and Stalingrad, was one of the three primary strategic goals of Operation Barbarossa. By 1939, Leningrad was an manufacturing center accounting for nearly 11 percent of the Soviet Union's industrial output. Its symbolic importance as both the former capital of Russia and the center of the Russian Revolution also made it a vital location to achieve a decisive victory over the Soviet Union. Once known as St. Petersburg, the city had been renamed in honor of Vladimir Lenin after the formation of the USSR. It has been said that Hitler was so confident in the capture of the city that he had already printed invitations for victory celebrations in the Hotel Astoria located there.\n \nNow that the victory party is over, the order to destroy the city has been issued. In its place, the new city of Adolfsburg will be constructed to serve as the capital of the Ingermannland province as per the decree in Generalplan Ost.;;;;;;;;;;X;

1000667desc;The Soviet capital city of Moscow was a critical component in both German war aims and Red Army logistics during the war on the eastern front. A historic Russian city, also a core transit and population center, it was the political seat of power for Stalin and his party.\n \nHitler and his generals disagreed on the significance of capturing the city during Operation Barbarossa. While the generals of the Wehrmacht believed in the classic wartime strategy of seizing an enemy's capital to force a surrender, Hitler believed that the nature of modern warfare demanded that capturing an enemy's industrial and resource base was the only way to achieve success, and thus focused the campaign's attention on Ukraine and then moving towards the oil fields in the Caucasus. Whether or not the capture of Moscow in 1941 would have caused the capitulation of the USSR is still a popular topic of discussion today.\n \nWith the city in German hands, Hitler's vision for the fate of Moscow will now be enacted. All valuable works of art and historic relics have been evacuated from the city to be showcased in museums to teach future generations. Moscow will be completely leveled and the remains transformed into an artificial lake via the destruction of the Moscow-Volga canal.

1000669desc;"Stalingrad, a historic Russian city situated on the banks of the Volga River, was another critical objective for the Wehrmacht during the war on the eastern front. Known as ""Tsaritsyn"" for centuries until the Bolshevisk Revolution, it was rennamed ""Stalingrad"" in honor of Josef Stalin. The capture of this city was seen by Adolf Hitler as an important symbolic objective, bearing Stalin's namesake and serving as an important transit and logistical hub for the Red Army.\n \nHistorically, the Wehrmacht controlled up to 90 percent of the city during the legendary Battle of Stalingrad. Ultimately, German blitzkrieg tactics failed to subdue the city and it would serve as the breakwater point for German expansion where it began to recede upon the decisive defeat and loss of the entire German 6th Army.\n \nHitler has decreed the annihilation of this last major Soviet city, motivated primarily by a desire to wipe Stalin's name from the historical record. The city will be razed to the ground without prejudice, destroying a potential hub of resistance and achieving another symbolic victory for the Reich.";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000673name;The Icebreaker;;;;;;;;;;;
1000673desc;"After the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, it quickly became clear that the Soviet Union had been enormously underestimated. Upon commencing the invasion, it was discovered that the USSR had hundreds of divisions that were not accounted for by initial intelligence reports, and possessed the largest land army ever seen in human history. Only through the lightning precision of the German blitzkrieg were these forces effectively neutralized and victory was achieved. If the Reich had been locked into a war of attrition, defeat would have been inevitable against the overwhelming numbers and industrial resources of the Red Army.\n \nFollowing the German victory, important documents were found in Moscow that revealed Stalin's shocking plans - he had intended to use Hitler to wear down the western Allies and then strike from the east, seizing a weakened Europe and spreading the Bolshevik revolution from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and from there, the entire planet!\n \nOnly through a preemptive strike was Germany able to save Europe from this nightmarish scenario. As Hitler delivers a public broadcast to the world detailing this sinister communist scheme, he cites these documents and the titanic size of the Red Army as evidence that speaks for itself. Stalin's idea of using Hitler as an ""icebreaker"" to soften the world for his Red Dawn sends chills through families everywhere as they listen intently to Hitler's speech. Thanks to the vigilance of the Third Reich, the world has been saved from a terrible fate.";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000674desc;The Stalin Line was a series of fortifications first established in the 1920s to protect the USSR against attacks from the west. The fortifications were designed to funnel invaders along specific channels to assist in defending an enormously long geographic front, with the line stretching all the way from the Baltic coast to the border of Ukraine. When the Germans invaded in 1941, much of the line was unfinished and in disrepair, and thus of little use against the blitzkrieg.\n \nWe may dismantle these fortifications and reuse the materials for ourselves now that our eastern border has been established far beyond this frontier.;;;;;;;;;;X;

After the war had been won in its entirety, these networks would expand to cover all of Europe and potentially all the way to India and beyond the Urals.\n \nThis modern transportation network would serve the Reich's economic and logistical interests, forming the arteries of the New Order and backbone of a National Socialist inspired concept of Mitteleuropa.

1000680name;South Tyrol Option Agreement;;;;;;;;;;;
1000680desc;The South Tyrol Option Agreement refers to the period between 1939 and 1943 where the native German population of South Tyrol, ceded to Italy since the end of the First World War, was given the option of emigrating to the Greater Germanic Reich or being assimilated into Italy. Historically, over 80 percent of the residents of the area opted to move to Germany.\n \nThe question of ownership of South Tyrol met with fiercely competing opinions among German and Italian nationalists, both between each other and within their own groups. Although the area predominantly spoke the German language, Italian irredentist theories claimed that the population was ethnically Italian and had been Germanized over the course of centuries. After the Austrian Anschluss, Adolf Hitler decided to settle this dispute with Mussolini by formally renouncing claims to the province and used this to gain diplomatic leverage with the Italian fascist leader.\n \nWith Generalplan Ost well underway, many Germans in this territory have been granted incentives to take part in the colonization of the east, including land grants, fully equipped farms, military protection and other state-sponsored programs from the Reich to assist in the settlement of their new homes. Similar programs are also taking place in Elsass-Lothringen, the Low Countries and Schleswig-Holstein.;;;;;;;;;;X;

1000681name;Manifest Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;
1000681desc;"The term ""Manifest Destiny"" typically refers to the 19th century expansionist doctrine of the United States into its westward frontier. The spirit of American exceptionalism imbued the new nation with an powerful sense of its own destiny to cover the American continent from coast to coast. It was the essential duty of the American people to civilize an untamed, wild land inhabited by native savages. Framing this concept in a sociological perspective, this was the American nation's ""conquest"" phase where a nascent tribe surges forth with raw energy, eager to test its strength and prove itself on the world stage.\n \nAdolf Hitler took great inspiration from this concept, consistently referring to the USA as the ""American Union"" and praising the idea of Manifest Destiny. He expressed his admiration for the Anglo-Saxon nation's successful acquisition of western Lebensraum in various literature, including Mein Kampf. Hitler viewed the American subjugation of its native populations as a parallel to his own ambitions of conquering European Russia for essential living space and resources needed to ensure the Reich's survival and independence.\n \nAs Generalplan Ost makes progress, Hitler has made various speeches exemplifying the ideology of social darwinism taken to its natural conclusion, that the weaker races of the planet must inevitably be subjugated by the stronger in order for mankind as a whole to progress and for civilization to flourish. He continues to use the historical example of the United States as a basis for this philosophy, causing great debate among those interested in the topic.";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000682name;Blut und Boden;;;;;;;;;;;
1000682desc;"The concept of ""Blut und Boden"" (Blood and Soil) is an ideology of German origin that emphasizes the relationship of a nation to both its blood ancestry and the land that it cultivates. It is a philosophy that strongly emphasizes agrarian life and the peasant's connection to the soil of the land, decrying the corrupting influence of modern urbanization and its negative effects on a nation's spirit. Strong men and women, the backbone of a healthy nation, can only be raised in an environment where a nigh-divine connection exists between them and the soil that they live upon.\n \nForming a core principle of Adolf Hitler's desire for Lebensraum, Blut und Boden is the driving ideology behind the settlements established in Generalplan Ost. Advertised as a way for the German worker to escape from the stifling, unnatural existence of urban life, the Blut und Boden propaganda campaign has been successful in attracting German families to abandon the city in the interest of seeking a new, more fundamental purpose on the German frontier.";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000683name;Wehrbauer;;;;;;;;;;;
1000683desc;"Wehrbauer, which translates to ""soldier peasant"" in English, is a concept used by the SS that refers to soldiers that are to be designated as the initial settlers of the conquered lands of the east.\n \nSimilar to the medieval Ordensburgen which fortified territory against natives in the Baltics, these soldier peasants would not only serve as the base for Germanization in the east, but provide for their own defense against native uprisings and resistance to the colonization process. These men would primarily be composed of veterans of the SS and given land grants as rewards for their service in the German military.\n \nHitler detailed his vision for the soldier peasant during one of his dinner meetings recorded by Martin Bormann. After twelve years of service, these veterans were to be given equipped and furnished farms in the eastern territories. A heavy focus on agricultural education and an emphasis on raising large families with peasant wives would ensure a strong foundation for the Blut und Boden philosophy to become incorporated into the eastern conquests, ensuring Germanization over the course of a few generations. As Generalplan Ost progresses, these Wehrbauer are critical to the success of our settlement of the east, and every available resource has been allocated to ensuring their prosperity.";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000684desc;"In 1725, geographer Philip Johan von Strahlenberg printed the first recorded designation of the Ural Mountains as the eastern demarcation between Europe and Asia. Adolf Hitler believed that the Urals only formed a geographic designation - it would require the Germanization of the former Russian territories for the Ural Mountains to truly represent the far eastern border of Europe itself, and was the long-term ambition behind the conquest of the USSR.\n \n""The real frontier is the one that separates the Germanic world from the Slav world. It is our duty to place it where we want it to be. If anyone asks where we obtain the right to extend the Germanic space to the east, we reply that, for a nation, its awareness of what it represents carries this right with. It is success that justifies everything. The reply to such questions can only be of an empirical nature. It is inconceivable that a higher people should painfully exist on a soil too narrow for it, while amorphous masses, which contribute nothing to civilization, occupy infinite tracts of a soil that is one of the richest in the world... We must create conditions for our people that favour its multiplication, and we must at the same time build a dike against the Russian flood [...] Since there is no natural protection against such a flood, we must meet it with a living wall. A permanent war on the eastern front will help form a sound race of men, and will prevent us from relapsing into the softness of a Europe thrown back upon itself. It should be possible for us to control this region to the east with two hundred and fifty thousand men plus a cadre of good administrators...

1000685name;Operation Charlemagne;;;;;;;;;;;
1000685desc;After the success of Operation Barbarossa, the Third Reich focused its attention toward consolidating control over its conquests west of the Volga River. Meanwhile, the remnant of the USSR held a fragile grip onto its remaining assets in the Ural mountains, Central Asia, and Siberia. Thanks to Stalin's decision to move a large amount of the USSR's heavy industry into the Urals and Siberia, the industrial capacity of the revolutionary state was still enough to sustain what elements of the Red Army were not destroyed by the German blitzkrieg. Though they have been unable to do little but look across the Volga from the east, the Soviets still present a potential threat to the New Order.\n \nYears have passed since the conclusion of the first war against the USSR, and the Third Reich stands stronger than ever. Hitler's dream of expanding Europe's borders to the Urals is still unfulfilled - political practicality and the realities of the challenges presented by Operation Barbarossa prevented this from being attainable during our first peace treaty with the Bolshevik menace.

1000689name;Destruction of Bolshevism;;;;;;;;;;;
1000689desc;To Adolf Hitler, the ideology of Bolshevism represented the single greatest threat to European civilization. Rejecting Marxist socialism, he wrote in Mein Kampf and frequently spoke about the destructive nature of communistic thought, believing that it was the final manifestation of Judaic infiltration into western society. This doctrine would eventually lead to the enslavement of all Europeans, and eventually the entire world under their Jewish masters.\n \nHitler also believed that the ideology of social democracy practiced by the Allied powers was little more than a preliminary stage of Bolshevist evolution, a view that was heavily influenced by his experience living in the Weimar Republic. The infection of Jewish international financiers and their grip over the peoples of the planet was facilitated by these forms of government, and he believed that only the Aryan race and the doctrine of National Socialism had the strength to wage a war of complete annihilation on those whom would seek to enslave Germany and the rest of the world.\n \nFinally, the Soviet Union has been destroyed and with it, the incubation chamber for all forms of Bolshevism and Marxist thought. As Hitler makes his victory speech, he hails the Wehrmacht's success as not just another victory for Germany, but the assurance of the continuance of western civilization.

This Siberian protectorate would exist to absorb these populations and handle them appropriately, ensuring that insurgency in our eastern conquests is kept to a minimum. Economic exploitation of the vast resources of Siberia would also be facilitated through this regime.

Our targeted zones of colonization are flourishing, with new farmsteads and large families dotting the landscape that we seized from the Asiatic menace.\n \nBy right of conquest, we claimed this land.

1000701name;Division of Power;;;;;;;;;;;
1000701desc;On December 15, 1941 the Japanese proposed to Germany a division of the respective spheres of influence on the Asian continent. This proposal delimited a territorial arrangement with a division along the 70th meridian east longitude. The Germans were initially apprehensive about this proposal, fearing that it established an unwelcome precedent for future partitions of political entities along this dividing line, and that it failed to contain any promise of Japanese military support against the USSR.\n \nThe Wehrmacht further criticized this proposal because it arbitrarily cut through existing states with no concern or attention given to natural geographical features or economical concerns that made the existence of these entities possible. They counterproposed a division that would follow existing state boundaries, which ran along the eastern border of Iran, northern Afghanistan, the western border of China and then along the Yenisei River.\n \nHistorically, Hitler approved the Japanese proposal. This was likely because he did not believe that Germany would realistically ever gain Soviet territory beyond the Ural Mountains.;;;;;;;;;;X;

The hypothetical A-A line was to stretch from the port city of Arkhangelsk on the White Sea along the confluence of the Volga river to the port city of Astrakhan on the Caspian. This study envisioned that the campaign would take between nine and seventeen weeks to complete.\n \nOperation Barbarossa was to intended to accomplish this objective before the onset of winter in 1941. This would result in the occupation of the vast majority of the Soviet Union's industrial, population, food and fuel centers and render it incapable of posing a threat to Germany after the war was concluded. The remaining Soviet industrial centers eastward in the Urals and beyond were to be destroyed by aerial bombardment.";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000703desc;The state of Turkey in the Second World War was precariously balanced between all three major factions - the Germans briefly examined both Turkish cooperation and occupation, and Italian ambitions in the Mediterranean came dangerously close to Turkish borders. The British were well aware that Turkey straddled the gateway between Europe and the Middle East and could be used as an avenue to strike into Syria. Finally, the Soviet Union with its historical Russian antagonism towards the Ottoman Empire did not let any of these concerns go unnoticed, and knew that their possessions in the Caucasus could come under threat if Turkey were to find itself aligned towards the Germans.\n \nDuring the course of the war, Turkey came under our occupation. We must now decide the fate of this region. Anatolia is a diverse area full of national groups with various interests, many of them that have been under centuries of occupation. We must balance these groups with own interests in the area, the ambitions of our allies, and of course the future of the Turkish nation itself.

Control of this region is critical to the survival and future prosperity of the Third Reich.\n \nIt may be wise to expand a buffer zone into eastern Anatolia and northern Persia to ensure that Baku is shielded from any future conflicts that might happen in the area. German administration of the varied nationalities in these areas under one consolidated rule would better ensure that we will have better control over them. It would be unwise for us to allow Turkish or Armenian nationalists to interfere with our vision.\n \nWe will still have the chance to examine the possibility of autonomy for these local nationalities in the area regardless of our decision.;;;;;;;;;;X;

The discussion between himself, Alfred Rosenberg and other minds of the party never reached a consensus on the best form of management for this area. Examine these options carefully.

1000710name;The Swedish Question;;;;;;;;;;;
1000710desc;Sweden found itself in a tenuous position during the events of the Second World War. Having maintained its neutrality since the end of Napoleonic Wars in 1815, it was only through a careful balance of diplomatic maneuvering and concessions to Germany that Sweden was able to maintain its sovereignty and avoid direct involvement in the conflict. During Operation Barbarossa, Sweden allowed the Wehrmacht railway transit for personnel and munitions into Finland. The country was also a vital trading partner that supplied critical iron ore to the Reich. As the war neared its conclusion in 1944 and 1945, they allowed the Allies to use Swedish air bases. Sweden also became an important destination for refugees fleeing the war, including Jewish and other persecuted populations.\n \nHitler's personal of view of the Swedish was generally positive, as he viewed the Scandinavian people to be of the purest Nordic descent. Sweden was not occupied during the war for a variety of reasons, not least of which was that occupation would have been costly and that the Swedes were generally compliant with the Reich's interests. With the conclusion of the war against the Soviet Union, their incorporation into the Greater Germanic Reich can now be accomplished. It is time to unite all Germanic people under our banner!;;;;;;;;;;X;

1000714name;Fate of Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;;;
1000714desc;The Reichskommissariats in western Europe differed considerably from their eastern counterparts. The regimes set up in Belgium and the Netherlands were intended to factilitate a transitional incorporation into the Reich, in contrast to the Russian conquests which focused on colonization and exploitation. Historically, a Reichskommissariat division did not encompass all of Scandinavia, though the regime established in Norway serves as an example for this concept. Hitler vowed that he would never leave Norway, and even favored the annexation of Denmark at a later date. The Nordic people of Scandinavia were destined to become part of the Reich once Hitler's vision came to fruition.\n \nNow that we have brought all of Scandinavia under our control, we can create a new Reichskommissariat to ensure that this area will become an integral part of the German nation. Its population will retain their native languages and customs for a time, while the next generation will be educated to identify solely with their Germanic racial character and no longer see themselves as part of disparate nationalities. They will be taught to celebrate their Aryan heritage and embrace National Socialist ideology. With time, the Greater Germanic Reich will be one people and one nation!;;;;;;;;;;X;

Through our guidance, the nations of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Britanny have found themselves united and on the map once again. They have been allowed to conduct a Celtic Congress to celebrate their shared national identity.\n \nGerman National Socialism generally viewed these people as one of the last few remaining traces of pure European heritage, which should be celebrated and protected.

A highly regimented program of raising young Germans was put into place in National Socialist Germany with a strong emphasis on physical activities, martial trianing and identity with the German nation and state.\n \nNow that we are the new masters of Europe, we are installing a program of German language schooling throughout the various nations. The language that one speaks has a profound influence on his or her identity and their ability to express themselves. If one thinks and speaks in German, it is a critical step to eventually becoming German themselves if they are racially worthy. If this is combined with carefully planned population settlement and state-sponsored programs to support large families, the German nation will skyrocket and make full use of the Lebensraum in the east.\n \nWith time, patience and dilgence, German will become the new dominant language and its people the undisputed masters of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;X;

1000717name;French fascism takes root;;;;;;;;;;;
1000717desc;As the new regime in France becomes more accepted by its population, the ideas of French fascism are taking hold. One of the most unique aspects of fascist ideology is the unique character that it takes based upon the national character of the people that it finds itself manifested within.\n \nWithin the French State, legendary figures such as Joan of Arc and the Gaulish chieftan Vercingetorix are seeing a resurgance in popular art and literature. Cultural icons such as these serve as the foundation for the identity of the French nation. Petain frequently addresses his people via radio broadcast, celebrating the destruction of the Third Republic and its excessive, degenerate nature. Only through a period of purifying French society could the dangerous ills wrought by the old ideals of liberty, equality and fraternie be cured.\n \nDespite suffering from the peace terms imposed by them by the Germans, a sense of Anglophobia is even more dominant among the French, placing the blame squarely upon them for dragging France into such a terrible war that saw the end of their sovereignity as a state. However, many are now seeing this as not a disaster at all, but rather a blessing that the guiding hand of National Socialism has pulled them out of the darkness of liberal ideologies and into the strength and unity of a coherent, vital nation that is so critical to the future of the French State and French nation.;;;;;;;;;;X;
1000717a;We must undo the damage done by the French Revolution.;;;;;;;;;;X;
1000718name;Mitteleuropa;;;;;;;;;;;
1000718desc;"The concept of ""Mitteleuropa"" was first known to have been theorized in 1848 by Karl Ludwig von Bruck and Lorenz von Stein. This notably German concept envisioned a united customs and market bloc of European nations with the goal of facilitating trade between these states. The term ""Mitteleuropa"" has gained various connotations from this first formulation.\n \nIn 1915, German thinker Friedrich Naumann wrote about the realization of the Mitteleuropa concept as a way to achieve Prussian economic and cultural hegemony over Europe through the eventual domination of the German Empire. This would be achieved by establishing a number of satellite states who would serve as markets for the German economy and allow it to better compete with powers such as Britain and France. This was seen as a severe threat by the British Empire, who took close notice of these ambitions and how it might affect their own markets.\n \nWith our growing domination of Europe, vestiges of the Mitteleuropa concept are manifesting themselves. Although National Socialist ideology promotes independence from foreign trade and an eventual goal of national autarky, the exploited resources from our conquests in the east along with vital trading partners such as Portugal and Romania are ensuring that our economy is running smoothly. With time and consolidation, Germany will be the undisputed military, economic and cultural masters of Europe.";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000719name;Leon Degrelle's ambitions;;;;;;;;;;;
1000719desc;Leon Degrelle was the founder of Belgian Rexist Party, which advocated for a moral renewal of Belgian society that would be accomplished through the Catholic Church. This was modeled similarly to Italian fascism in that advocated for a corporatist organization of society and denounced the ideologies of liberal democracy as having a degenerating influence on the Belgian nation. In 1936, Leon met both Mussolini and Hitler, whom provided 2 million lire and 100,000 marks respectively to show their support for Rexism.\n \nWhen the war began, Degrelle approved of King Leopold III's neutrality, but soon found the Rexist party split upon the German invasion. He was accused of collaboration, arrested, and evacuated to France. After the occupation of France began, he was released and then returned to Belgium to reconstruct his own vision of Rexism in close union with National Socialism. He joined the Waffen-SS as the leader of the 28th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Wallonien and served on the eastern front during Operation Barbarossa.\n \nDegrelle was one of the most outspoken candidates of the concept of the resurrected Burgundian state, and it was assumed that he would become the first chancellor of this new German entity. His vision was to restore the domain of Charles the Bold before his death in 1477 under his own rule. Now that the Burgundian state has come into being, Leon has asked us to merge the regime in Belgium into the SS-Ordensstaat to see this dream become a reality.;;;;;;;;;;X;

Although Switzerland maintained strict neutrality as it had done for centuries, there was serious concern about the intentions of the Third Reich and whether or not Switzerland would be Hitler's next target. Predominantly German-speaking in its central territories with a substantial Francophone population in the west and Italian and Romansch spoken in the south, the Swiss Confederation felt its multilingual, decentralized democracy was under extreme threat by Hitler's vision of a Greater Germanic Reich and the National Socialist worldview.\n \nWith the war in Europe finally drawing to a close, it is time to decide upon the fate of Switzerland. Hitler's own views on the Swiss are distinctly negative and his desire to wipe it from the map are quite clear. The only reason for the existence of the Swiss state was due to the weakness of the Holy Roman Empire and now that the Germanic Reich has been forged, its existence is no longer necessary. There is no room for a banker's haven situated directly in the middle of Europe, and one in which hostile powers can easily foster subversive elements and host spy networks.

The Swiss terrain in the heart of the Alps is very difficult to invade, nigh impossible in certain areas. The Swiss system of national mobilization along with their National Redoubt defensive strategy ensured that any invasion would be incredibly costly and not worth the time or resources of hostile powers. The country also served as a convenient area for diplomatic negotiations and as a place to store economic assets, leading to the famous Swiss reputation for their banking ability.\n \nNow that we have decided to invade Switzerland, they have triggered their National Redoubt defensive plan. Major bridges and tunnels have been destroyed, making it incredibly difficult for our forces to traverse this rugged terrain. The Swiss Army has also withdrawn to their fortress complexes and intend to make a desperate last stand against our forces.

He consistently referred to it as the ""American Union"" and held a combination of distaste and respect for American society and the American state, respectively. While he praised the American model for forming a racially strong mixture of European peoples and its national expansion in the concept of Manifest Destiny, he criticized the state for gradually relaxing these policies in favor of an open society and integration with other foreign nations, particularly its citizens of African ancestry. He also highly distrusted the American financial sector, believing it was the ultimate haven for internationalists and was completely controlled by Jewish interests.\n \nWhile American fears of a German invasion were primarily motivated by war industries hoping to profit from public anxiety, there were German concepts planned for long-range bombers and other methods of inflicting damage in a so-called ""war of continents"" that Hitler believed may erupt one day between a German-dominated Europe and the USA. In reality, Germany had no ambitions or any practical possibility of an invasion of North America.\n \nThe time has come to destroy the final safe haven of both Bolshevisks and international capitalism.

1000731desc;"The surrender of the French Third Republic to the Third Reich stunned the world - France, still seen as the strongest military power in Europe and arguably throughout the world, was not expected to capitulate in the summer of 1940. Even the German General Staff had serious doubts about the viability of the campaign. As noted by Franz Halder on November 3, 1939 - ""None of the higher headquarters think that the offensive has any prospect of success."" Hitler's proposal carried an enormous risk that could have resulted in a catastrophic defeat for the nascent Reich.\n \nNot only did the Allies possess overall more tanks than the Germans in the spring of 1940, the British and French models were superior. In addition to this, the Allies had captured a draft of the initial invasion plans when a German plane crashed over Belgium in January 1940. Erich von Manstein, supported by Heinz Guderian and Gerd von Rundstedt, instead proposed an alternative plan - a ""sickle cut"" maneuver through the Ardennes forest directly into France around Sedan. This plan was phenomenally risky, as it was a 300 kilometer race to the coast with no supporting infantry and had the potential to completely cut off the advancing Panzer divisions. The plan was successful and the Allies were caught completely off-guard, resulting in a decisive military victory for the Germans.\n \nWhere the Deutsches Heer had not been able to achieve success in the 4 years of the First World War, the Wehrmacht was able to conquer France in a matter of weeks. The world was left stunned, and the British now stood alone.";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000732desc;"The German Empire had been forced to sign its instrument of surrender in 1918 in a railway carriage at a location about fifty miles northeast of Paris in Compiegne. This exact same railway car had been housed in a French museum until Hitler ordered it to be delivered to the precise spot that Germany had been forced to surrender 21 and a half years prior. The arriving French delegation immediately recognized Hitler's objective of a symbolic humiliation and revenge for the Treaty of Versailles.\n \nDespite Hitler's intention to humiliate the French being clear to all, the drafters of the Armistice inserted ""Germany does not have the intention to use the armistice conditions and armistice negotiations as a form of humiliation against such a valiant opponent.""\n \nThe Alsace-Lorraine Monument (depicting a German Eagle impaled by a sword) was destroyed and the site obliterated, aside from the statue of Ferdinand Foch. The carriage itself was taken to Berlin along with pieces of a stone tablet that had the following inscribed in French: HERE ON THE ELEVENTH OF NOVEMBER 1918 SUCCUMBED THE CRIMINAL PRIDE OF THE GERMAN REICH.

1000733desc;"Before achieving his fame as the ""Desert Fox"", General Irwin Rommel and his command of the 7th Panzer Division played a critical role in the Battle of France. Rommel had no prior experience commanding a division, but did have close personal ties to Hitler. By 1940, the two had developed a personal liking for each other, each sharing their dislike of the elitism of the old German aristocracy and finding solidarity in each other's humble backgrounds. Rommel desired command of a panzer division, which was granted - any objections from the army being overruled by Hitler himself. His style of leading from the front, often from the top of a tank, earned great respect from his men and gave him a heroic aura that German propaganda quickly capitalized upon.\n \nWhen the invasion of France began on May 10, 1940, Rommel and the 7th Panzer Division raced ahead to their objective at Avesnes. Reaching the town, Rommel had prior orders to halt, but continued to press forward. During this time, the division would briefly lose radio contact with German high command, leaving their location virtually unknown. This, along with their reputation for speed and unpredictability earned them the nickname ""Ghost Division"". Rommel detailed his experience as a ""lightning tour of France"" and ""how wonderful it's all been"" in his diary.";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000734desc;"Spain found itself in a delicate position in the summer of 1940 after the momentous victory of the Third Reich over the French Republic. Francisco Franco had lead the Spanish Nationalist coalition to victory in a brutal civil war that left the country devastated. The people were starving and industrial output was crippled, along with constant guerilla skirmishes from the remaining opposition left the Spanish State in no position to enter into foreign entanglements.\n \nAfter the fall of Paris, Franco was impressed by Germany's performance. He knew that he owed Hitler a debt for his critical support during the Civil War, but also knew that Spain was critically vulnerable to the British navy and there was absolutely no popular support for war. From Hitler's perspective the capture of Gibraltar was a valuable objective, but Franco's demands for French Morocco and enormous material support were too high - he did not want to risk alienating the friendly French regime in Vichy and Spain was more valuable as a ""window"" to potentially bypass a British blockade.\n \nUltimately, Spain remained as a non-belligerent during the war but provided volunteers from the radical Falange party that become famously known as the Azul Division, which would fight alongside the Wehrmacht during Operation Barbarossa. The meeting between Hitler and Franco at Hendaye did not go well - Franco's high demands and statement that Spain cannot enter the war ""por gusto"" (for fun) and Hitler's impression - ""I would rather have teeth pulled than meet with Franco again!"" ended negotiations for Spain's entry to the Axis bloc. Regardless, Franco maintained a neutral position that favored Axis interests while keeping war-ravaged Spain from entering the global conflict.";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000738desc;The Turkish Republic, a nation battered by the first World War and its own war of independence only decades ago, is balanced on a razor's edge between the competing factions of the Second World War. A devastated economy and its new vision for a modern Turkish nation put it into a position of strong neutrality. When German Panzers came within 50 miles of Istanbul during the invasions of Yugoslavia and Greece, the Turkish government destroyed key bridges in anticipation of further German aggression in the area. A non-aggression pact signed in 1941 just 4 days before the invasion of the Soviet Union eased tensions for all factions involved, as Turkey was sharply watched by the Axis, Allies, and Soviets alike for its critical position.\n \nWith the success of Operation Barbarossa, Turkey may no longer take a neutral stance. The Reich must have total control over the Black Sea for the transportation of crude oil from the Caucaus oil fields and the grand visions of Generalplan Ost in Crimea, along with ensuring travel through the Bosphorus Strait is under our control. The Middle East must be brought into our sphere of influence, and Turkey stands in our way. While Hitler has a nominal respect for the Turks as being former allies in the First World War, he knows that the head of state of the Turkish Republic, Ismet Inonu, cannot be trusted.

After the success of Operation Sealion, it was expected that London would quickly capitulate and seek favorable terms while the Führer was still willing to engage them in an equitable discussion. This estimation was yet another gross miscalculation of the British national spirit. the Führer would later ascribe the nature of this conflict as a demonstration of Aryans fighting Aryans, a tragic waste that would have never taken place if it were not for the corrupting Bolshevik influences in the United Kingdom.\n \nEver since the first Panzer laid down tracks on English soil, the fighting has been utterly relentless. British citizens, men, women and children alike seem to believe they are engaged in a conflict that challenges their very right to exist. Slash and burn tactics, tank traps, roadblocks, improvised explosives and an armed citizen around every corner has made the invasion of Great Britain a desperate affair. Despite repeated attempts to open channels with the British High Command, they have gone unanswered - until today. With England completely overrun by the Wehrmacht, we have received a dispatch from the surviving members of the British military leadership.

1000903desc;The history of the British Isles is a tumultuous one, full of conflict and struggle. Ranging from bitter civil wars such as the War of the Roses in the 15th century or the campaign of William the Conqueror, Great Britain has been anything but a tranquil place. Over the course of centuries, the very identity of the British nation had been forged in blood from invasions by various groups, many of them Germanic in origin. Whether it was the Angles, Jutes, Saxons, Normans, Vikings, Celts or the ancient Romans, the British people have been refined through ages of conflict.\n \nIn accordance with National Socialist ideals, Adolf Hitler believed the Aryan identity of the English was a prime example of social darwinist theory and that the British Empire could not have rose to become the largest empire ever seen in world history without these racial strengths. He would frequently comment in his writing and discourse that he never desired a war with the British, and would have preferred to have their empire as a natural ally of the Reich. History would record that the conquest of the United Kingdom was only conducted because Hitler's hand had been forced, and that the degenerate elements of internationalists and Bolsheviks had to be purged from an otherwise Aryan nation.\n \nNow that the British Isles have once again been conquered by Germanic strength, a New Order is dawning on Europe. Remaining pockets of British resistance continue their fight, but the bulk of their armed forces have either been annihilated or obeyed the order to stand down. The Third Reich has accomplished an invasion that has not been seen since 1066, and never again will the British interfere with Germany's ambitions in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;X;

The best color cameras and recording equipment have been brought in to record the proceedings, ensuring that the Reich's victory over the internationalist bankers and Bolshevik corruption will be preserved for future generations.\n \nThe failure of the British to respond to multiple attempts at a negotiated peace demonstrated Hitler's fundamental misunderstanding of British political goals, and this lack of understanding would ultimately be one of the major causes of the Second World War. It would also result in the eventual conquest of the British Isles and the historic meeting of various nationalist figures and German sympathizers all eager to earn their place in the New Order.\n \nWe have several options available to us.

There are many that believe it was only through the stubborn will of Winston Churchill that the British did not capitulate.\n \nWith the succesful conquest of the British Isles, we now have the opportunity to recreate the United Kingdom with our direct interests in mind.

1000909desc;"The British Union of Fascists was a political group founded by Oswald Mosley in 1932. Initially enjoying considerable popular support, endorsement of the group began to wane as it became increasingly radicalized. The 1936 Battle of Cable Street saw a clash between the BUF and anti-fascist groups, eventually leading to the Public Order Act of 1936 which banned political uniforms in the United Kingdom. This affected Mosley's party considerably who were known as the ""Blackshirts"" from the uniforms they wore. Growing fears of a pro-German organization within the United Kingdom itself eventually lead to the arrest of Oswald Mosley and most prominent members of the BUF, leading to its banishment in 1940.\n \nWe now have the opportunity to install Oswald Mosley as the leader of the United Kingdom and resurrect the British Union of Fascists. While this option aligns the least with the Reich's direct interests in Britain, it is also the least punishing settlement we can reasonably impose on the British Isles. Mosley models many of his ideas after Mussolini's fascist regime in Italy, with the notable exception of an insistence on isolationism and no imperialist ambitions. His strong anti-communist stance and assurance of the British limiting their interests to only their island would ensure that the Reich could pursue its goals free of British interference.";;;;;;;;;;X;

The Allied powers also showed considerable interest in Ireland, and the country's leadership had to maintain a careful balance of diplomatic relations in order to not compromise their neutrality.\n \nWith the occupation of the British Isles, the area of Northern Ireland came under our control. We can now decide on how to best leverage this situation to advantage. If we were to grant these provinces to Ireland, we could easily bring them into our sphere of influence. Given the geopolitical situation with the collapse of the British Empire, they would realistically have no choice but to accept. This would then allow us to influence the leadership of Ireland to align with our vision of the European New Order, along with ensuring our security in the northern Atlantic and creating a counterweight towards the British.

For many years, he pursued a dream of mutual cooperation and an ultimate goal of an alliance between the two powers. These hopes were decisively crushed in 1939 when the United Kingdom declared war upon Germany, obstensibly in the defense of Polish sovereignty. Hitler's desire to work alongside the United Kingdom demonstrated Germany's inability to understand British geopolitical and economic goals, which were aligned towards preventing any one single entity from dominating continental Europe. These desires ran completely against Germany's vision in both the first and second World Wars, pitting the two states against one another much to the frustration of German statesmen in both cases.\n \nMultiple attempts at reaching a peace agreement with the United Kingdom were attempted, including a claim that Rudolf Hess offered the withdrawal of Germany from western Europe in exchange for a free hand against the USSR, which was refused. The authenticity of this claim is still in dispute today, but it is well known that Hitler attempted multiple peace negotiations from 1939 to 1941, all of which were unsuccessful. The larger-than-life personalities of Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler symbolized this fateful match between the two European powers.\n \nNow that the USSR has been crushed, the United Kingdom yet again stands alone against the Third Reich.

The obstinate and stubborn attitude of Winston Churchill has spit in the face of our good intentions. Even though the British Empire and her Commonwealth stand alone against us, they still refuse to see reason and come to terms with the Reich.\n \nDespite all of Europe being under our control, they still persist in their resistance to the New Order. There is no other reasonable explanation other than a misguided faith that the United States will be able to come to their rescue.\n \nIn reality, there is an argument to be made that the British were not in a position to ever accept peace due to the German-dominated ""loaded gun"" of the Atlantic Coast after the Fall of France, which would forever be pointed directly at Britain. Hitler had shown that he could not be trusted in diplomatic dealings, and many British feared it would only be a matter of time until his continental hegemony and aggressive ideology eventually turned towards Britain years after a peace was concluded. This was yet another example of the existential nature surrounding the conflict of the Second World War, and that only the complete domination of one faction would be able to lead the world into a new order.\n \n""After making one proposal after another to the British on the reorganization of Europe, I now find myself forced against my will to fight this war against Britain..."" - Adolf Hitler";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000923name;Defense of the British Isles;;;;;;;;;;;
1000923desc;After the Fall of France in 1940, the possibility of a German invasion of the British Isles became a serious consideration by the British military. The planned defense of the home islands was quite extensive, showing that the British were very serious about their concern of Operation Sealion actually taking place.\n \nAside from the direct involvement of the British Army, RAF and Royal Navy in this planned defense, the Local Defense Volunteers (LDV - later known as the Home Guard) group was created. This volunteer force numbered 1.5 million men by the end of June 1940 and were to be deployed in the defense of Britain if an invasion took place. An extensive system of field fortifications was also constructed, most notably coastal fortifications supplemented with barbed wire, minefields, planned flooding, tank traps and other deterrents to ensure that German armor would be unable to penetrate into England.\n \nBeyond these considerable defenses, the British were prepared to use even more extensive strategies to stop an invasion. Planned destruction of bridges, slash and burn tactics of both food and fuel, full mobilization of the civilian population, insurgency networks and even poison gas attacks were to be used in the defense of the home islands.\n \nWith the fall of the USSR, the British are redoubling their efforts on these defensive measures.;;;;;;;;;;X;

1000927desc;Dawn breaks on the still waters of the British coast. The restless garrison manning the beach fortifications struggle to keep a vigilant eye on the horizon, months of guard duty rendering their senses dulled. With the protection of the RAF and Royal Navy, the thought of the Germans actually landing on the British Isles is unthinkable. If they even got close, they would then have to attempt the most complex amphibious assault in recorded history. Such confidence made it understandable to be surprised when the attack finally happened.\n \nA staggering number of German vessels come into sight in the morning sun, and an alarm is immediately sounded. British guards sound warning bells and radio back to London that the invasion has begun. A cataclysmic battle takes place as elite Seebataillon units disgorge from modern and sophisticated landing craft, with heavy casualties on both sides. The RAF and Royal Navy prove to be unable to prevent the landings, and the defensive fortifications are eventually overrun. The Kriegsflagge flies above what remains of the British bunkers as a beachhead is established.\n \nNow that we have successfully accomplished the initial objective of Operation Sealion, the full invasion of the British Isles can begin.

1000931desc;The Bank of England was created in 1694 and is located in London's main financial district, the City of London. In the late 17th century, the English treasury was in dire condition. After a lengthy war against France, England had the need to build a powerful navy. No public funds were available, which lead to the creation of the Bank of England. In 1694, England's credit was in such terrible shape that its loans were set at 8 percent interest per annum with a 4,000 pound annual charge for management of the loans. Many legends and conspiracies surround this institution, including the idea that the American Revolution was based largely in part to escape the financial strangehold that the Bank of England held over its American colonies.\n \nIn recognition of the New Order dawning in Europe, Hitler has decreed that this bank be destroyed and its assets shipped back to Germany. A new non-inflationary system of currency will be put into place, similar to the bills issued by the Reichsbank. This will not only make the British economically dependent on Germany until this new currency can replace the British pound, but ensure that their very survival is based on our new regime. Existing British assets will be closely reviewed by a liquidation committee and the individuals or companies reimbursed accordingly.\n \nFinally, this despised stronghold of international bankers that would seek to enslave Germany has been destroyed and the British people are free from its tyranny.;;;;;;;;;;X;

It contained the names of 2,820 people, including British subjects and European exiles who were to be taken into custody.\n \nCreated as an appendix to the Gestapo's handbook Informationsheft GB, it numbered 104 pages and listed individuals such as Winston Churchill, Neville Chamberlain, Anthony Eden and even individuals no longer present in the isles after 1940, such as famous writer Aldous Huxley.\n \nHimmler has made all of the necessary preparations. Travel into or out the British Isles has been strictly prohibited since the first day of our occupation, and the Gestapo are in position in all major cities and locales where these individuals are known to be residing.

1000933desc;Winston Churchill was a controversial figure throughout his long career working for the British government. From the debacle at Gallipoli to his obstinate refusal to negotiate with Germany during the Second World War, the fate of Britain rested squarely on his shoulders. Casting Churchill as a war criminal responsible for the destruction of the British Empire barely even took a concerted propaganda effort on our part.\n \nWe have allowed a trial to take place in the Supreme Court of Judicature, presided over by native Britons. Showcases like this are useful for quelling the most basic elements of British resentment against our rule, giving them a common enemy to despise aside from ourselves. Winston Churchill has been found guilty of a long list of heinous crimes, including conspiracy against the British people, reckless leadership and responsibility for the disaster that resulted in the loss of British sovereignty.

1000934name;Scottish Nationalists;;;;;;;;;;;
1000934desc;"One of the more obscure ideas presented during the Second World War was a petition from Scottish nationalists to proclaim an independent Scottish Republic with the guarantee of German assistance. They offered to proclaim a pro-German uprising in Scotland in the event that the Germans managed to invade England.\n \nThe German minister in Dublin, Eduard Hempel, informed Berlin that the proposals came from a group calling itself the Scottish Independence Movement. It called for a ""German-Scottish Alliance"" against ""the gross materialism of the capitalistic-communistic union of English, Americans and Bolsheviks"". Historically, Hempel was concerned that this proposal would give the British an excuse to have him expelled from the country. Berlin responded that he explore the possibility of this alliance, but the historical record becomes unknown after this point.\n \nThanks to our successful conquest of the British Isles, the dreams of these Scottish nationalists have become a reality. In exchange for their autonomy, we have gained a valuable ally in ensuring that the English are kept in check by a separate national group on their home island. The Scottish and the Irish will form a very useful Celtic counterweight to ensure that the English never become strong enough that they dare to defy our new regime.";;;;;;;;;;X;

It also manufactured tanks and artillery components.\n \nNow that this shipyard is in our hands, we can request their services for the Kriegsmarine.

1000936desc;"Oswald Mosley was a pioneer of fascist ideology, representing the genesis of the unique character of British fascism. Mosley believed in denouncing multicultural ideas, believing in a closed society by and for the British people. He believed that state ownership and market capitalism had both failed, and supported a new system of ""industrial democracy"" in which employees would become stakeholders in their companies. By instituting this system of labor, he believed it would promote greater incentives in the workforce since their share of the profits would depend directly on their own ability and initiative.\n \nMosley also believed in the abolishment of the income tax, a drastic reform of central banking, and a New Model parliament that would operate on the fundamental ideology of a technocracy - experts within their respective fields of industry would nominate leaders from within their own vocations, ensuring those most suited for the job would be selected.\n \nFinally, he believed in outlawing the practice of designing products with built-in obsolescence, believing that this exploitation of the consumer was reprehensible and that products should be designed to last. Housing shortages and other critical needs for the British people must be addressed with the highest priority, and the the motto of ""Britain First"" encompassed his innovative ideology.";;;;;;;;;;X;

1000938name;The British are using poison gas attacks!;;;;;;;;;;;
1000938desc;Poison gas and chemical warfare saw its first industrial application in the First World War. The horrific effects of substances such as mustard gas gave the war its distinctive character of inhumanity, and had a dramatic effect on the collective psyche and culture of the European nations involved in the conflict.\n \nDespite all of Hitler's fervent ambitions, he did not utilize poison gas during the war. A mutual detente between Germany and its enemies would ensure that these nightmarish substances would never be utilized all throughout the war - if neither side used it, they would have some amount of protection from the other side using the same tactics against them. Some theorize that Hitler's own experience with being temporarily blinded by a gas attack in the Great War influenced this decision. The air superiority of the Allies also ensured that German cities would be helpless against such attacks if Germany broke this unspoken agreement.\n \nAfter World War 2 concluded, it was discovered that Germany was in possession of large quantities of tabun, a powerful nerve gas. If this was utilized during critical moments such as D-Day, it could have changed the course of the war. The fear of gas retaliation and mutual understanding was so powerful that these substances were not used even during the most desperate battles.\n \nThe British have committed the unthinkable. As our forces establish themselves throughout England, we have received the first reports of mustard gas being sprayed upon the beaches, along with chlorine and phosgene. The relatively humane nature of the war in the West has been forever broken.;;;;;;;;;;X;

We have taken control of vast swathes of the USA despite fierce resistance from the local population. Despite their incredible landmass and unprecedented industrial capacity, the Americans are reeling from blow after blow inflicted by the Wehrmacht. The United States High Command has offered their unconditional surrender, realizing that continued struggle is pointless and that they no longer have the support of their own citizens in the face of such a defeat.\n \nA grand ceremony is taking place to hallmark the founding of the world's first superpower - with the conquest of the United States, the Reich has risen to the status of a global empire and none are left to challenge us. To permanently cripple the USA, we will demand the occupation of the eastern coast at a minimum. If we so choose, we can also dissolve the union and create entities such as California and Texas to partition the former United States.

Fritz Kuhn, the leader of the German-American Bund, has been released from prison by our occupation forces and could serve as a perfect figurehead to begin consolidating our rule over the eastern American coast. Although the German-American Bund received no official support during the war, we could reconstitute the party as our ruling regime in a new political entity - the American Union State. This regime will usher in a new era of National Socialism in America and lead her people to a new age.\n \nThis occupation regime will require extensive support from Berlin, but it may be our best option for the time being. Fritz Kuhn is a native German whom has absolutely unquestioned loyalty to the Reich, and will serve our directives without us needing to be concerned about our new American possessions going astray.

1000947name;Fate of Canada;;;;;;;;;;;
1000947desc;"At the beginning of the Second World War, Canada was a quasi-independent dominion of the British Empire and was brought into the war along with the United Kingdom. This was a subject of some controversy, as the 1931 Statute of Westminster had given Canada fully sovereign status and the decision to participate in a European war was questioned by both the government and the public. Memories of the 1917 Conscription Crisis that divided French and English Canadians was still fresh in recent memory. However, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King was loyal to British interests and had made the decision to follow Britain into war even before the outbreak of the conflict on September 1, 1939.\n \nNow that the Wehrmacht has overran Canada and forced their surrender, we need to decide upon its future. Hitler's personal perspective of Canada were more or less aligned with his views on the United States, and he gave Canada little attention. He viewed Canada as an extension of the United States and believed that it would one day annex Canada as a matter of due course, and that the Canadians would likely welcome this event.\n \nWe have the opportunity to create a new Canadian regime friendly to the Reich under the guidance of Adrien Arcand, leader of the Christian National Social Party and self-titled ""Canadian Führer"". We may also consider giving the French Canadians their own state - yet another great opportunity to implement a nationalist divide-and-conquer policy to ensure that our interests around the globe stay loyal to directions from Berlin.";;;;;;;;;;X;

It may be wise for us to grant control of Alaska to one of our allies that will be able to look after its security far better than we can from Berlin.

EVT_NAME_1100000;Schwerer Gustav and Dora;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_DESC_1100000;Schwerer Gustav was a German 80 cm railway gun developed in the late 1930s by Krupp. The gun was designed in preparation for the Battle of France, but was not ready for action when the battle began, and in any case the Wehrmacht's Blitzkrieg offensive through Belgium rapidly outflanked and isolated the Maginot Line's static defenses, eventually forcing the French to surrender and making their destruction unnecessary. Gustav was later deployed in the Soviet Union during the Battle of Sevastopol, part of Operation Barbarossa, where among other things, it destroyed a munitions depot buried in the bedrock under a bay. The gun was moved to Leningrad, and may have been intended to be used in the Warsaw Uprising like other German heavy siege pieces, but the rebellion was crushed before it could be prepared to fire. Gustav was destroyed by the Germans near the end of the war in 1945 to avoid capture by the Red Army. Dora was the second gun produced. It was deployed briefly against Stalingrad, where the gun arrived at its emplacement 15 kilometres to the west of the city sometime in mid-August 1942. It was ready to fire on 13 September. However, it was soon withdrawn when Soviet encirclement threatened.\n \nSchwerer Gustav and Dora were the largest-calibre rifled weapon ever used in combat and, in terms of overall weight, the heaviest mobile artillery piece ever built. It fired the heaviest shells of any artillery piece. It is surpassed in calibre only by the unused British Mallet's Mortar and the American Little David bomb-testing mortar.;;;;;;;;;;X;

EVT_DESC_1100001;Formed in June 1943, the unit was commanded by Otto Skorzeny and was based at chateau Friedenthal just north of Berlin in Sachsenhausen by Oranienburg, consisting originally of the three hundred members of the former SS-Sonderverband z.b.V. Friedenthal and Sonderlehrgang z.b.V. Oranienburg. After an unsuccessful attempt to train members of an SS penal facility, Skorzeny obtained permission to recruit volunteers from the Wehrmacht, and 100 SS personnel, 50 Luftwaffe and 150 Army personnel were admitted, allowing the formation of a headquarters company and two line companies. An intensive training programme was instituted. \n In September 1943, fourteen members of this unit took part in the Gran Sasso raid, which resulted in the rescue of deposed Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.They were later placed on standby for several operations that never took place, including a proposed kidnapping of Philippe Pétain. In September 1944, SS-Jger-Bataillon 502 was dissolved and its personnel absorbed into a new battalion, SS-Jagdverband Mitte.;;;;;;;;;;X;

EVT_DESC_1100002;The Sovetskaja Ukraina was laid down in 1938 in Nikolaev at the Black Sea. When German troops captured Nikolaev, the ship was completed up to the main deck, although it was slightly damaged by the retreating Russian troops. Since the planned  main armament precisely matched the armament of the German H-class battleship, Germany initially planned to continue the construction of the ship. Due to the lack of ressources and manpower, the consttuction of Sovetskaja Ukraina was abandon in 1942 and some of the armor and secondary artillery was used for the fortification of Sevastopol. \nIn 1943 the construction was continued with a low priority and when the Germans were forced out of Nikilaev in March of 1944, they destroyed the incomplete ship by explosives.;;;;;;;;;;X;

EVT_DESC_1100004;Werner Baumbach, born on December 27th 1916, entered the Luftwaffe in 1936 and after first training at the 2nd Air Warfare School was trained as a bomber pilot. He was one of the first pilots to fly the Junkers Ju 88 bomber and flew various bombing missions with Kampfgeschwader 30. On 19 April 1940 he bombed and damaged the French cruiser Émile Bertin for which he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class. By August 1942 Baumbach received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords for the destruction of over 300,000 gross register tons of Allied shipping. Then, Baumbach was removed from active pilot duty and started working on new bomber designs; among others, he helped design the composite bomber system Mistel. In 1944, he was placed in command of the newly formed Kampfgeschwader 200 and was in charge of all Luftwaffe special missions. Baumbach was promoted to Oberstleutnant on 15 November 1944 and was tasked with leading the affairs of the General der Kampfflieger.\n \nAfter the war, Baumbach spent three years as a prisoner of war before he moved to Argentina where he worked as a test pilot. He died in a plane crash on 20 October 1953 while evaluating a British Lancaster bomber.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_NAME_1100005;Michael Wittmann;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_DESC_1100005;Michael Wittmann, born on 22 April 1914, in Vogelthal, joined the German Army in 1934. Discharged as a corporal in September 1936, the ambitious young man then joined the Waffen SS in April 1937 and was assigned to the elite Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). During the brief Polish campaign and then in the German blitzkrieg sweep into Belgium, Holland, and France, he commanded a six-wheeled heavy armored car on reconnaissance sorties. \n When Nazi armies swarmed across the Russian border on June 22, 1941, the LSSAH panzers rolled southward and Wittmann quickly distinguished himself as a tank commander in the first of many clashes with the Red Army.In less than a year of action on the Eastern Front, Wittmann was credited with 66 tank kills. Wittmann was awarded the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves on 30 January 1944 for the destruction of 117 tanks, making him the 380th member of the German armed forces to receive it. Wittmann received the award from Adolf Hitler personally at the Wolf's Lair, Hitler's headquarters in Rastenburg, on 2 February 1944. On 7 June, following the Allied Invasion of Normandy, the battalion was ordered to move to Normandy, where Wittmann became known for the Battle of Villers-Bocage on 13 June 1944. While in command of a Tiger I tank, he destroyed up to fourteen tanks and fifteen personnel carriers, along with two anti-tank guns, within the space of fifteen minutes. The news was picked up and disseminated by the Nazi propaganda machine and added to Wittmann's stature in Germany.\n \nOn August 8th 1944, Wittmann died in a battle, when his Tiger tank was destroyed during an ambush near the French town of Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil. During his career, he recorded 138 tank kills, 132 anti-tank gun kills, and destroyed hundreds of trucks, carriers, artillery, and errant sportscars.;;;;;;;;;;X;
EVT_NAME_1100006;Dmitry Lavrinenko;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_DESC_1100006;Dmitry Fyodorovich Lavrinenko, born on September 10th 1914 was a Soviet tank commander and Hero of the Soviet Union. He was the highest scoring tank ace of the Allies during World War II. \n A descendant of Kuban Cossacks, Lavrinenko finished his training at Ulyanovsk Tank Academy in May 1938. He took part in Soviet campaigns in Poland in 1939 and Bessarabia in 1940. In 1941, he commanded the new T-34/76 tank. With 58 tanks and self-propelled guns eliminated in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa on the Eastern Front of World War II, he is considered to be one of the top Soviet tank aces of the war, despite his early death in 1941. He achieved such impressive results by taking advantage of the abilities of the T-34. The tank's armor and great mobility were clearly taken into consideration by Lavrinenko. On December 18, 1941 Lavrinenko was killed just after freeing the village of Goryuny and knocking out his 52nd tank. Immediately after the action the Germans began shelling the village intensively. Lavrinenko got out of his T-34 near the village and tried to reach the commander of the 17th Armoured Brigade, Lt Col N. Chernoyarov, in order to report his victory but he was killed by a German mortar shell fragment. \n The total number of tanks damaged and destroyed by Lavrinenko is comparatively small next to aces like Michael Wittmann (138 tanks and 132 anti-tank guns), Otto Carius (150 tanks), Kurt Knispel (168 tanks), and several others. However, almost all the German tank aces of the war fought from start to finish, so their overall results were more significant. Lavrinenko destroyed 52 tanks in just 2.5 months of fierce fighting in 1941. This was an outstanding result in the Soviet Army, and no single Allied tank officer surpassed him during the whole war.;;;;;;;;;;X;

EVT_DESC_1100007;On this day in 1941, the 24th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, Joseph Stalin, premier and dictator of the USSR, delivered a speech to a rally of Moscow Party workers. The rally was held underground, in the marbled halls of the Mayakovsky train station. There, Stalin encouraged the assembled Communist Party workers with the promise that if the Germans want a war of extermination, they shall have one.\n \nThen  the annual Revolution Parade in honor of the October Revolution 24 years earlier was held. Standing atop Lenin’s Mausoleum in Red Square, Stalin took the salute of his troops and encouraged them to defend holy Russia —even as German tanks, previously mired in mud, began to roll over now—frozen ground in their advance toward the Soviet capital. It should be the last Revolution Parade in a war that should last for four years and cost millions of lives.;;;;;;;;;;X;
EVT_NAME_1100008;Amber Room;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_DESC_1100008;The Amber Room or Yantarnaya Komnata was a world-famous chamber decorated in amber panels backed with gold leaf and mirrors, located in the Catherine Palace of Tsarskoye Selo near Saint Petersburg. Although it was originally created in early 18th century in Berlin, it was given by the Prussian King Frederick William I to his then ally, Tsar Peter the Great in 1716. In Russia, the room was expanded, and after several renovations, it covered more than 55 square metres and contained over 6 tonnes of amber. \nShortly after the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in World War II, the curators responsible for removing the art treasures in Leningrad tried to disassemble and remove the Amber Room. However, over the years the amber had dried out and become brittle, making it impossible to move the room without crumbling the amber.The Amber Room was therefore hidden behind mundane wallpaper, in an attempt to keep German forces from seizing it. Predictably, the attempt to hide such a well-known piece of art failed. German soldiers of Army Group North disassembled the Amber Room within 36 hours under the supervision of two experts. On 14 October 1941, the priceless room reached Königsberg in East Prussia, for storage and display in the town's castle. \nIn August 1944, Königsberg was heavily fire bombed by the Royal Air Force. It suffered further extensive damage from artillery from the advancing Red Army before the final occupation on 9 April 1945. Its current whereabouts remain a mystery, but it is highly believed that the room was destroyed during these raids.;;;;;;;;;;X;
EVT_NAME_1100010;The road of life;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_DESC_1100010;By 8 September 1941, the German Army Group North under Feldmarschall Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb had almost completely surrounded Leningrad, successfully cutting off all major supply routes. To address this growing concern, a decision was cast by the Military Soviet of the Leningrad Front to establish an evacuation commission in November 1941. As the severity of the siege intensified, the committee proposed the construction of an ice road over Lake Ladoga as both a viable supply line and means for civilian evacuation en masse. The Road of Life began to operate on 19 November 1941 after Captain Mikhail Murov and his transport regiment carried the first supplies over Lake Ladoga via horse-drawn sleigh. However, due to proximal bombardments, ice breakage, and unreliable machinery, the route was far from fully functional at this time. It was only in mid-December, after troops of the Volkhov front recaptured Tikhvin, that construction of a railroad directly connecting the western shore of Lake Ladoga to Leningrad was possible. \n The siege lasted for 29 months from 8 September 1941, to 27 January 1944. Over one million citizens of Leningrad died from starvation, stress, exposure and bombardments. Each winter, the Lake Ladoga ice route was reconstructed by hand, and built according to precise arithmetic calculations depending on traffic volume. In addition to transporting thousands of tons of munitions and food supplies each year, the Road of Life also served as the primary evacuation route for the millions of Soviets trapped within the starving city.;;;;;;;;;;X;

EVT_DESC_1100011;As the German Messerschmitt Me 262 Schwalbe holds the distinction of becoming the world's first operational jet-powered fighter, the Arado Ar 234 Blitz is recognized as the world's first operational jet-powered bomber. The system arrived in 1944 and became active into 1945, serving until the end of war in 1945. It proved one of the more technologically advanced and prized weapons of the German Luftwaffe but was never available in the numbers required. The aircraft proved so advanced, in fact, that it was able to evade all available Allied interceptors of the time, making it a very capable reconnaissance and high-speed bombing platform. Unfortunately for the Germans, related testing and manufacture facilities were disrupted consistently, fuel supplies restricted and factories ultimately overrun by advancing Allied fronts limiting production to a few hundred examples by war's end. The West seemingly benefitted the most from the captured technology, the Americans in particular designing, developing and producing several jet-powered bombers of the Cold War that superficially resembled the wartime Ar 234 series to an extent (though frequently on a much larger scale). The Ar 234 became the German Luftwaffe's second jet-powered aircraft to enter service following the more recognizable Me 262.;;;;;;;;;;X;
EVT_NAME_1100012;Junkers Ju 87 'Stuka';;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_DESC_1100012;Before the Allies would gain air superiority over the skies of France and Germany, the Junkers Ju 87 'StuKa' dive bomber would reign supreme. The system, for a time, became the terror of both civilian and soldier alike, as the screaming howl of its 'Jericho Trumpet' sirens filled the sky with a shriek before letting lose with the aircraft's payload. In essence, the dive bomber was, for the first time, being used to critical effect - an almost forecasting of the capabilities of today's direct-strike precision bombing. The name 'StuKa' comes from the longform 'Sturzkampfflugzeug' which translates to 'Drop-Down-Fight-Airplane'. Once World War 2 had begun in September of 1939, the Stuka was a featured set piece for the German Luftwaffe in its conquest of Poland. The system earned its deadly reputation early on due to its precision strike abilities. Following the collapse of the Polish defenses, and the fall of Norway, the Low Countries and France, it was also used in the Battle of Britain, but with limited sucess. \nIn an effort to shore up its limitations, the Ju 87D model was revealed and these were posted along the East Front and during the North African Campaign. The Ju 87G model came online as a dedicated 'tank buster' armed through twin 37mm cannons. This particular entry provided new life to the series and would later prove to be one of the most successful designs of the war.;;;;;;;;;;X;
EVT_NAME_1100013;Blocking Detachment;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_DESC_1100013;In the Red Army of the Soviet Union, the concept of barrier troops first arose in August 1918 with the formation of the 'blocking troops' or 'anti-retreat detachments'. The barrier troops were composed of personnel drawn from Cheka punitive detachments or from regular Red Army infantry regiments. The first use of the barrier troops by the Red Army occurred in the late summer and fall on the Eastern front during the Russian Civil War, when commander Mikhail Tukhachevsky was authorized to station blocking detachments behind unreliable Red Army infantry regiments in the 1st Red Army, with orders to shoot if they either deserted or retreated without permission. \nThe concept was re-introduced on a large scale during the Second World War. On June 27, 1941, in response to reports of unit disintegration in battle and desertion from the ranks in the Soviet Red Army, the 3rd Department of the USSR's Narkomat of Defense issued a directive creating mobile barrier forces composed of NKVD personnel to operate on roads, railways, forests, etc. for the purpose of catching 'deserters and suspicious persons'. On September 12, 1941, Joseph Stalin issued the Stavka Directive No. 1919 concerning the creation of barrier troops in rifle divisions of the Southwestern Front, to suppress panic retreats. Each Red Army division was to have an anti-retreat detachment equipped with transport totalling one company for each regiment. Their primary goal was to maintain strict military discipline and to prevent disintegration of the front line by any means, including the use of machine guns to indiscriminately shoot any personnel retreating without authorization.;;;;;;;;;;X;
EVT_NAME_1100014;IS-2 'Josef Stalin';;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_DESC_1100014;The Soviet Army need for ever-more formidable tracked firepower came to the forefront after losses of much territory to the invading Germans in the summer of 1941. The stout KV heavy tank series (KV-1 and KV-2) proved adequate but only an extent for they lacked the necessary battlefield mobility of the fabled T-34 medium tank series while utilizing similar weaponry. The KV-1 was more of a tank-killer with its F-34 76.2mm main gun. The KV-2 mounted a 152mm howitzer and was more of a fire support vehicle thank tank destroyer. The T-34, while an ever-evolving system, lacked the required firepower with its base 76.2mm main gun and armor protection was limited, particularly against the ranks of the newer German Panther and Tiger heavy tank series. As such, endeavors were undertaken by the Red Army to present newer and better systems to level the playing field. One such development therefore became IS series of heavy tanks - popularly known as the 'Josef Stalin' series - the most powerful tank to serve in the Red Army during all of World War 2. The IS family set the stage for Soviet tank development doctrine for decades to come.;;;;;;;;;;X;

During World War I, he served on the western front and was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class as well as the House Order of Hohenzollern. When the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Werner von Fritsch, was accused of homosexuality, Hitler appointed Brauchitsch a colonel general and the new army chief, on the recommendation of the Army High Command on 4 February 1938. Even though Brauchitsch was in charge of operational affairs during the Polish and French campaigns, he had very little influence, as a whole, as to the war's progress. \nWhen Germany turned East and invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, he played a key part, making modifications to the original plan. As the Battle of Moscow got under way, his health was starting to fail. Even so, he continued his work, as he was determined to take Moscow before the start of winter. The army's failure to take Moscow earned Hitler's enmity, and things worsened for him, as he suffered a heart attack in November. He was also informed that he had a malignant cardiac disease, most likely incurable. In the aftermath of the failure at Moscow, Brauchitsch was dismissed as Commander-in-Chief of the German Army and replaced by Adolf Hitler himself on 19 December. He was transferred to the Führerreserve, where he remained without assignment until the end of the war.;;;;;;;;;;X;

Baku was one of the richest, producing 80 percent of the Soviet Union's oil—about 24 million tons in 1942 alone. The Caucasus also possessed plentiful coal and peat, as well as nonferrous and rare metals. Manganese deposits at Chiaturi formed the richest single source in the world, yielding 1.5 million tons of manganese ore annually. The Kuban region also contained vast swaths of wheat, corn, sunflower seeds and sugar beets. \n \nToday, Soviet forces have attained control of the city after a lightning-quick invasion from the east and support from massive artillery and aerial bombardment.

EVT_DESC_1100030;Roessler, a German expatriate from Bavaria who fled to Geneva when Hitler came to power, was working as a publisher at the outbreak of World War II in Switzerland, producing anti-Fascist literature. Roessler was approached by two German officers, Fritz Thiele and Rudolph von Gersdorff, who were part of a conspiracy to overthrow Hitler, and had been known to Roessler in the 1930s through the Herrenklub. \n \nThiele and Gersdorf wished him to act as a conduit for high level military information, to be available to him to make use of in the fight against Fascism. This they accomplished by the simple expedient of equipping Roessler with a radio and an Enigma machine, and designating him as a German military station. In this way they could openly transmit their information to him through normal channels. Roessler's first major contribution to Soviet intelligence came in May 1941 when he was able to deliver details of Operation Barbarossa, Germany's impending invasion of the Soviet Union. Following the invasion, in June 1941, Lucy was regarded as a VYRDO source, i.e. of the highest importance, and to be transmitted immediately. Over the next two years 'Lucy' was able to supply the Soviets with high grade military intelligence. During the autumn of 1942, 'Lucy' provided the Soviets with detailed information about Case Blue, the German operations against Stalingrad and the Caucasus. In the summer of 1943, the culmination of 'Lucy's' success came in transmitting the details of Germany's plans for Operation Zitadelle, a planned summer offensive against the Kursk salient, which became a strategic defeat for the German army. \n \nThe Lucy spy ring came to an end in the summer of 1944 when the German members, who were also involved in other anti-Nazi activities, were arrested in the aftermath of the failed July plot.;;;;;;;;;;X;

EVT_DESC_1100031;When Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, it quickly became apparent that the Soviet Air Force was not prepared for war. Poor planning and lack of organization left planes sitting on the tarmac at airbases, allowing the Luftwaffe to destroy 4,000 Soviet planes within the first week. The disorganized Soviet defenses and technologically deficient aircraft were no match for the Luftwaffe.  \n \nIn 1942e major factors contributed to the resurrection of the Soviet Air Force. One aspect was the mostly successful evacuation of the aircraft industry and the lack of German attacks on this industry. Furthermore, the successful creation of a talented command staff and successful reorganization, which was supported by Stalin. The restructuring efforts included the transformation into air divisions, whereas each division consisted of one type of aircraft, which improved the logistics and command efficiency. Additionally, the use of on-board radios grew, which allowed better coordination with ground stations for warning and command-and-control. There were also tactical changes like the creation of special ace units and the use of free hunts with experienced pilots. The Soviet Air doctrine focused strongly on fighters in order to achieve air superiority, thus a considerable effort was spent to develop the fighter arm into an elite force.;;;;;;;;;;X;

He graduated from the Chuguev Military Air School in 1941 at the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, but he was retained as an instructor. Kozhedub remained at the school for two years where he trained many young Soviet pilots.

From an altitude of 100 feet, the aircraft crews dropped their bombs straight onto the decks of the ships - not skipped them up to or into the hulls. These first efforts failed to sink the ships. However, demonstrate the precision of a low-altitude attack. The British continued to use low-altitude techniques and eventually began to incorporate skip bombing into their tactics. \n \nAmerican skip bombing began on August 26, 1941, when General Henry 'Hap' Arnold, Chief of the Army Air Forces, heard details of a British skip bombing attack at an Allied conference in England. Upon his return from England, General Arnold charged developmental teams at Eglin Army Airfield, Florida with the task of creating an American version of skip bombing.

EVT_DESC_1100037;During the first days of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Germans came unprepared to encounter Soviet T-34 medium tanks and KV heavy tanks. Although the Wehrmacht succeeded in most operations due to superior tactics, air support and supply, the lack of anti-tank weapons capable of successfully engaging these vehicles at range was becoming evident. An urgent need arose for a mobile and powerful enough anti-tank weapon than the already existing towed anti-tank guns or tank destroyers like the Panzerjäger I. Among a series of solutions, it was decided to use surplus light tanks, like the Panzer II, and captured vehicles, like the Lorraine Schlepper, as the basis for makeshift tank destroyers. The result was the Marder series, which were armed with either the new 7.5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank guns or captured Soviet 7.62 cm F-22 Model 1936 field guns, large numbers of which had been acquired early in the war. Its high profile and thin open-topped armor provided minimal protection to the crew. Nevertheless, the Marder II (and similar Marder III) provided a great increase in firepower over contemporary German tanks during 1942 and into 1943. \n(two brigades will be placed in your building quee, ready in 60 days, to simulate usage of capture equipment during Barbarossa);;;;;;;;;;X;
EVT_NAME_1100038;The Battle of Bialystok-Minsk - Captured Equipment;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_DESC_1100038;The Battle of Bialystok-Minsk was a German strategic operation conducted by the Army Group Centre during penetration of the Soviet border region during the opening stage of Operation Barbarossa. Its goal, the encirclement of the Red Army forces around Minsk, was accomplished. The Soviet troops trapped in the gigantic pockets continued fighting, and concluding operations resulted in high German casualties. An estimated 250,000 Soviet troops escaped because of the lack of German infantry troops' motor transport that slowed the encirclement process. Most of them were later sent to penal battalions. There were 290,000 Soviet soldiers captured, and 1,500 guns along with 2,500 tanks were destroyed or captured. The quick advance east created the possibility for the Wehrmacht to advance rapidly towards the land bridge of Smolensk from which an attack on Moscow could be planned. It also created the impression in the OKW that the war against the Soviet Union was already won within days of its start.;;;;;;;;;;X;
EVT_NAME_1100039;The Battle of Smolensk - Captured Equipment;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_DESC_1100039;The Battle of Smolensk was fought around the city of Smolensk between 10 July and 10 September 1941, about 400 km west of Moscow. The Wehrmacht had advanced 500 km  into the USSR in the 18 days after the invasion on 22 June 1941. Historically, the Germans were able to link up and close the pocket east of Smolensk on 27 July, trapping large portions of 16th, 19th, and 20th Armies. Under the leadership of 20th Army, Soviet troops managed to break out of the pocket in a determined effort a few days later, assisted by the Soviet offensive efforts along the Smolensk front line. In the end, about 300,000 men were taken prisoner when the encirclement was re-established and the pocket eliminated. A total of 1,348 - 3,273 tanks and guns along with 903 aircrafts were either destroyed or captured by the German Army.;;;;;;;;;;X;
EVT_NAME_1100040;The Battle of Kiev - Captured Equipment;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT_DESC_1100040;The First Battle of Kiev resulted in a very large encirclement of Soviet troops in the vicinity of Kiev and is considered the largest encirclement in the history of warfare (by number of troops). The operation ran from 7 August to 26 September 1941 and encircled much of the Southwestern Front of the Red Army (Mikhail Kirponos), although small groups of Red Army troops managed to escape the cauldron, days after the German pincers met east of the city, including the headquarters of Marshal Semyon Budyonny, Marshal Semyon Timoshenko and Commissar Nikita Khrushchev. Kirponos was trapped behind German lines and killed while trying to break out. \n \n The battle was an unprecedented defeat for the Red Army, exceeding even the Battle of Białystok-Minsk of June-July 1941. The encirclement trapped 452,700 soldiers, 2,642 guns and mortars and 64 tanks, of which scarcely 15,000 escaped from the encirclement by 2 October. The Southwestern Front suffered 700,544 casualties, including 616,304 killed, captured or missing during the battle. The 5th, 37th, 26th, 21st and the 38th armies, consisting of 43 divisions, were almost annihilated and the 40th Army suffered many losses. Like the Western Front before it, the Southwestern Front had to be recreated almost from scratch.;;;;;;;;;;X;

EVT_DESC_21371;Operation Pike is a conceived series of Allied bombing raids that were to be conducted by the Middle East Command against the Soviet Union's oil fields in Caucasus. Planned to be carried out during summer 1940, the bombing campaign was designed to cripple or eliminate the Soviet oil industry, causing fuel shortages throughout the Red Army and Soviet Air Force, as well as denying the Third Reich an important source of raw materials. While the French side pushed for the swift execution of the plan, British have taken a more cautious position, fearing that an Allied attack against USSR would lead to a German-Soviet alliance. Should the Allies proceed with the Operation Pike?;;;;;;;;;;X;

Among the priority targets were the cities of Grozny, Batum and Baku; casualties are currently estimated at several thousands, and the scale of infrastructure damage is unimaginable. Addressing the nation, Joseph Stalin proclaimed that this act of unprovoked aggression will not go unpunished.";;;;;;;;;;X;

EVT_DESC_21373;The German-Soviet Axis talks were a series of diplomatic negotiations concering the Soviet Union's potential entry into the Axis Pact.

In light of the MolotovRibbentrop Pact and extensive trade between USSR and German Reich, a full military alliance seemed like a natural continuation of friendly relations between the countries - in spite of their fundamentally incompatible ideologies.

EODAIP_SLO-HUN_1;The Slovak-Hungarian War was a brief skirmish between the armies of both countries, where Hungary attempted to conquer a strip of land on Slovakia's eastern border. This claim was supported by a 1910 census that suggested Slovaks weren't a majority in the area, and had the further goal of giving Hungary a railway going up to the Polish border. In-game, Slovakia can choose to try and hold out against the Hungarian attack.
