EODAIP - an AI focused Darkest Hour Mod

How to play:
Just unpack the folder in Mods, select the mod in Darkest Hour launcher.

Difficulty settings:
Instead of Easy > Hard, difficulty settings in EODAIP go between "Very Strong Axis" through "Balanced" to "Very Strong Allies". Player modifiers are not affected by those, outside of the faction they could be in. Neutral countries receive minor compensation changes and resource maluses on Very Strong Allies (to make resources scarce for the Axis and Japan)
